## What is Brume ?

Brume is a platform, fully open source, build from the ground up to be an all in one solution for your cloud needs. Brume can be installed easly, on a single machine or in a cluster, running on premises or in the cloud. Brume deals with all the complexity of the cloud, so you can focus on building your application.

_Just push it._

## Getting started

First try it by deploying an application to Brume Cloud, then self host your execution using a runner to finally run everything on your own machines. From the brume up!
